# FBLoginWithFirebase
I built this app while learning Facebook authentication and Firebase authentication in react-native. The app has 2 options to signup
* One is via the traditional text inputs and directly sending them to firebase
* The other is via Facebook login. It fetches the public_profile of the users and then sends it to firebase

## Steps to reproduce
1. Clone the repository by running the command `git clone https://github.com/nirmaldalmia/FBLoginWithFirebase.git`
2. Open a terminal window and cd into the project repository `cd FBLoginWithFirebase`
3. Install all the dependencies using `npm install`
4. Finally start your emulator or attach a physical android device and run the command `react-native run-android`
